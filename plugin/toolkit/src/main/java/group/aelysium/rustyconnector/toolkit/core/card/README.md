# CARD
CARD is an abstraction layer written on-top of the [EclipseStore](https://eclipsestore.io/) JVM persistence system.

CARD uses "Cards" and "CardHolders" to interact with the EclipseStore persistence layer.

The name "CARD" comes from the four main operations that can be performed:
- **C**reate
- **A**lter
- **R**ead
- **D**elete
